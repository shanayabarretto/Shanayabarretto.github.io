        <h2 style="color: #3b1109;">who i am</h2>
        <p>I'm Shanaya! I'm currently in my 3A term of mechatronics engineering and thoroughly enjoying it :) This program has allowed me to learn a lot about myself in multiple capacities. Notably, I've learned that I'm most excited about working on hardware designs and writing embedded software, and thus am consistently working to hone those skills. My time working on UW Orbital and at the Harvard Microrobotics Labaratory on Project CETI really highlighted this revelation for me. Through my co-ops, I've gotten the opportunity to work in various industries, from aerospace to marine, and spent a lot of time trying to understand what the common thread was between my favourite projects. I've determined now that I'm happiest doing work that allows us to learn more about our universe, and I hope to keep following this path in the future. Most importantly, I've learned how not to be daunted by a challenge. Learning how to make the best use of my resources and solve problems effeciently are my most vital takeaways from the program, so now the hardest challenges have become my favourite memories.</p>
        <p>Heading into university, I was fortunate enough to recieve the $100,000 Schulich Leader Scholarship, so away from my technical work, I volunteer with The Debtless Students- an organization that helps students fund their education. I am also a huge music lover! I play guitar and piano and deeply treasure my vinyl collection. I've also been interested in model trains for a few years and picked up some antique pieces at a convention this summer, I hope to set up a small layout of my own this fall!</p>
        <h2 style="color: #3b1109;">how i got here</h2>
        <p>There were a few events in high school that helped me confirm that I wanted to pursue engineering. My first introduction to the world was FIRST Robotics. The environment at work sessions & competitions was electric, and I really tested the limits of how much I could learn in a short amount of time. I loved contributing to the team and really value that experience. Beyond that, I took a computer engineering course and created my first hardware projects (& programmed in Assembly!). This course was the most fun I'd ever had, and I went on to become a TA for this course as part of my school's PATH program. I'm so thankful for the exposure I was able to get in high school, and compiled some of the projects I was able to complete here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pdLivuMACE">ðŸŽ¬</a></p>
        <p>The final push came after visiting the Kennedy Space Center. I'd been interested in space exploration for ages, but seeing firsthand the ingenuity that went behind these missions made me realize I wanted to be a part of something similar more than anything. And so my journey began :)</p>
        <h2 style="color: #3b1109;">where i want to go</h2>
        <p>I'm excited to see where life takes me but I do hope to keep contributing within the aerospace industry and to keep being challenged through my work. In terms of skills in the short term, I'm currently prioritizing learning about FPGAs though our AUV design team Deep Blue, and hope to complete a Rust project over my next co-op to gain some familiarity with the language. Continuing to learn is the ultimate goal!</p>

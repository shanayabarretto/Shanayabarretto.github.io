        <p>UW Orbital is what Iâ€™ve happily spent most of my time in university on and through that time I have held a number of different positions on the team. At first I started out as a member of the electrical power systems team, then eight months before our competition I became a lead. After our win at the <a href="https://www.csdcms.ca/">Canadian Satellite Design Challenge (CSDC-6)</a> we restructured to group teams by work and not subsystem, so I became an Electrical Lead as well as a Team Lead. At that point, we focused a lot of our energy on <a href="https://www.esa.int/Education/CubeSats_-_Fly_Your_Satellite">ESA's Fly Your Satellite 4 Programme</a>, which we were shortlisted for! This was an incredible experience which took place early this year that allowed us to tour the ESA facility in Amsterdam and compete for a launch opportunity. Though we didn't receive it this time, I hope to see Orion fly soon :)</p>
        <p>Iâ€™ve gotten to design and lead the development of multiple subsystems while on the team, including working on our battery management system (schematic for MAX17320 chip, layout with battery pack cutout, and testing snippet shown below), power distribution system (MPPT, bucks, load switch) and attitude determination and controls system (reaction wheels, magnetorquers, sun sensors, GPS, IMU). Thereâ€™s still lots to build on and improve, but the team has taught me so much - how to make clean schematics, important layout practices, PCB assembly methods, how to design functional and performance tests, how to be a good leader, and of course so much about the space industry in general.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™ve recently moved to advisor on the team to ensure more members have an opportunity to lead while still being involved and invested.</p>
        <p>Photos of the assembled CubeSat are also shown below!</p>

        <p>UW Deep Blue is an AUV Design Team that just started up this summer to compete in the <a href="https://robosub.org/">RoboSub competition</a>.</p>
        <p>A few of my friends saw a AUV-sized gap in the list of design teams our school offers and decided to fill it. Together, weâ€™ve formed UW Deep Blue, and hope to compete in the 2025 competition. Iâ€™m currently leading the Electrical team and focusing mainly on using an FPGA to process audio from our three hydrophones and guide our AUV around the playing field, and trying to design a 60-65Hz sonar transmitter to interact with other AUVs during the competition.</p>
        <p>Pictured below is our currently very limited inventory and intro meetings, Iâ€™m so excited to spend more time on it and see what we can build :)</p>

        <p>Though I completed this project quite long ago now, itâ€™ll always be really special to me. It was the first time I took something from an idea to fruition. Though quite simple looking back, finishing this project gave me a lot of confidence and drive to pursue engineering.</p>
        <p>In the heat of the pandemic I had talked to one of my teachers about subsequent struggles. He was teaching a CPR course without the ability to get close to students, which proved problematic. We came up with this idea to make a guidance tool with a pressure sensor that could go on a Resusci Anne unit, and would provide speed and pressure feedback via LEDs so that students could perfect the skill.</p>
        <p>So thatâ€™s what I did! A PIC16F690 controls the board and is programmed in Assembly Language. The board was designed on Eagle and some process photos are included below of the design, assembly, and test process. The final product can be seen in this video I compiled of some of my first projects: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pdLivuMACE">ðŸŽ¬</a></p>

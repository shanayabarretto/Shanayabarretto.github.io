          <p>I've harboured an interest in space for a long time, and begged my parents to take me to the Kennedy Space Center in 2019, which was my favourite trip of all time. Thus, when I got to Waterloo, I had to join some space related teams. Currently I'm a member of Waterloo Orbital and Waterloo Rocketry.</p>
          <p>On Orbital I do more electrical/circuit related work. I learned how to properly source components, how to use Altium, and a lot about MOSFETs and load switch circuits which was what I worked on for the Electrical Power Systems team this past term.</p>
          <p>I did more mechanical related work on Rocketry. Through contributing to the Rogallo Wing design, I gained practice doing stress tests on SolidWorks and expanded my knowledge of design principles.</p>

            <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">The Debtless Students</h2>
            <p>When I recieved the $100,000 Schulich Leader Scholarship, I knew wanted to help other hardworking students feel the same gratitude and excitement that I was feeling. Thus, I joined an organization called the Debtless Students made up of Schulich Leaders, Loran Scholars, TD Scholarship winners, and more, whoâ€™s goal aligned with my own. As a Scholarship Mentor, I help my mentees with essay and application content, find scholarships for them, and guide them through the university and scholarship application process. I also host webinars with my fellow mentors on the team.</p>

            <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold">Engineering Ambassadors</h2>
            <p>I became an engineering ambassador this past term and had a lot of fun connecting with prospective students and answering their questions. I remember attending open houses and using university resources like EngChats last year when I had a never ending list of questions, and was so happy to get well thought out answers from those ambassadors, that I wanted to be on the other side of those chats this year, and help some younger students out. I often meet with students over video chats to answer all their questions, and ran a chat booth this year during the Waterloo open house.</p>

          <p>Before entering university, my most prominent extracurricular activities included volunteering at the YMCA Employment Resource Centre, volunteering as a MiWay (Mississauga Transit) Ambassador, being the Deputy Prime Minister on Student Council, being a FIRST Robotics Team member, and being a member of the St. Vincent de Paul Society where we packaged and delivered food to the less fortunate. My work in the YMCA Resource Centre earned me an <b>Ontario Volunteer Service Award</b>, which I am very proud of.</p>

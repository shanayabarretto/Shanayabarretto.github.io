              <p>Playing piano is probably my favourite hobby, followed closely by ukulele. 
              I really hope to start learning guitar soon as well! I started playing piano about ten years ago, 
              and did lessons for a large amount of that time. I really enjoy taking my favourite songs 
              (dorothea by Taylor Swift, most recently) and learning them on piano. Last year my friend and I did a piano/guitar 
              duet to champagne problems by Taylor Swift (I am a big fan) for our school's talent show. 
              I picked up ukulele more recently during the pandemic and have been using the wide variety of 
              youtube tutorials to learn more songs.</p>

              <p>Embroidery was another hobby I picked up during the pandemic. 
                I have mostly worked on customizing shirts so far, and hope to start making a few for friends and family soon. 
                My favourite shirt I made is easily one inspired by the song mirrorball by Taylor Swift and a sweatshirt design 
                by an online store called Dizzy Dahlias.</p>

              <p>Over this co-op term, I found myself with a little extra time in the evenings, and returned to reading, 
                a hobby I grew to have less time for in the later years of high school. I love historical fiction, science fiction, 
                and mystery books. My most recent favourite is 'And Then There Were None' by Agatha Christie, and my all time favourite book is 'The Book Thief'
                by Markus Zusak.</p>

              <p>Something else I love doing is adding a bit of my personality to the jewlery I wear or the items I own. The first ukulele I bought 
                (as part of a build it yourself set) didn't hold its tune too well, so when I saved up for a new one, I decided to turn it into an art piece. 
                Disney music is super fun to play, so I decided to put my favourite characters on the ukulele. I also decided to make a few earring pairs for myself 
                and a friend with our favourite album covers on them (folklore- Taylor Swift, Fine Line- Harry Styles). I love completing small crafts projects like these 
                when I have some spare time.</p>

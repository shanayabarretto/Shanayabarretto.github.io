      <p>Quick disclaimer that there are a lot of words on this page! Shorter summaries can certainly be found in my resume, but I wanted to leave these here as diaries and capsules about everything I’ve learned in detail as well as key takeaways from my experiences. Enjoy!</p>

        <p>I'm only a few weeks into my four month internship at Rocket Lab, but it's been a <b>blast</b> (haha) so far! I've learned so much about the space industry from <b>radiation testing</b> to electronics requirements outlined in J-STD-001, and gotten to interface with and <b>design ground station hardware</b> for star trackers and reaction wheels that will soon be in space!</p>

          <h2 style="color: #1C6E8C;">Embedded Software / Electrical Engineer</h2>
          <p>Much of the engineering team on Project CETI works out of the Harvard Microrobotics Laboratory in Boston, MA which is where I was lucky enough to be this term. Project CETI is an initiative worked on by groups all around the world and tested in Dominica that aims to understand <b>sperm whale communication.</b> Tags are attached to whales via suction cups to collect audio data as well as other telemetry, which is the part I worked on.</p>
          <p>I was really able to expand my toolbox of technologies in this role, and am really happy I was encouraged to take photos to look back at. My time there can be summed up in four parts.</p>
          <p>For tag recovery, whale tags have a GPS antenna and module on them. In the beginning I worked on <b>characterizing different antennas</b> with the mechanical team who would perform waterproofing, and also evaluated the possibility of using an <b>Iridium</b> module. Much of this work allowed me to delve into RF and learn to use a <b>VNA</b>. As an extension of this, I recommended the addition of an LNA to our path and after iterating twice on my design, provided a <b>15 dB gain</b> (pictures below). Field testing post this addition showed very reliable signal lock. This taught me about signal integrity and RF hardware best practices. Then, I helped out with <b>audio localization</b> experiments done with three hydrophones, giving me some background on <b>DSP, filtering, and cross correlation.</b> Finally, I wrote <b>firmware for our MAX17320 BMS chip</b> that was to monitor a 2S pack of Li-Po batteries.</p>
          <p>I had so much fun at this internship. My technical knowledge grew immensely and I gained the ability to pick up skills and concepts much faster than I used to. I also learned more about my goals, which are to keep broadening my skillsets beneath the umbrellas of hardware and firmware, but also to do work that excites me and allows us to learn more about our universe.</p>
          <p>I’ve also linked a TED video about the initiative <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/david_gruber_and_shane_gero_how_advanced_is_whale_talk">here.</a></p>

        <h2 style="color: #1C6E8C;">Embedded Software Developer</h2>
        <p>My time as an Embedded Software Developer at onsemi was another incredibly fruitful experience. It was my first time more directly contributing to a <b>consumer facing product</b> and primarily working to improve a product rather than create one. This came with some differences, namely placing much more weight on smaller decisions in code. I really enjoyed this aspect as often in my own projects my primary goal is getting my idea working, as opposed to creating the best possible version, at least at first. It definitely made me a better developer and the difference in my thought process when writing now is very apparent.</p>
        <p>My biggest contribution was a <b>‘Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Scan & Connect’</b> sample app for the SDK of a dual mode radio/Bluetooth SoC (ARM Cortex-M3 based) frequently used in hearing aid devices. I also made multiple improvements to tracing and logging tools within the SDK. I was able to interface with more tools and technologies including <b>Bluetooth, DMA, NVIC, and GDB commands.</b> Additionally, I also worked frequently with UART and became very comfortable using <b>lab equipment (oscopes, logic analyzers, power supplies, etc.)</b> during my time here.</p>
        <p>Coming out of this experience I’m definitely more mindful of decisions I make, especially in software, and became much more confident working with memory, microprocessor architecture, etc.</p>

        <p>At Miovision I worked as a Firmware Developer. I was excited about it because I thought ‘hey, I’ve written firmware before’ but I’m happy to report I walked away from this experience knowing the knowledge I came in with was about 5% of what I knew at the end.</p>
        <p>I was and still am so thrilled by their mission as well: Miovision specializes in traffic control, and after installing hardware at intersections, works with cities to make roads more safe and efficient.</p>
        <p>This internship was where I got my first taste of <b>product ownership as an engineer.</b> My goal was to build a fixture for the production team that would allow them to test and <b>calibrate 8 cameras (and the IMUs within) simultaneously</b> after they’d undergone stress testing. I built this with an <b>NVIDIA Rudi-AGX</b> and different tools like <b>OpenCV, GStreamer, SCPI commands, V4L2 controls, and more.</b> I programmed mainly in C & Python for the backend and JavaScript (Vue framework) for the frontend and also got much more experience working with communication protocols.</p>
        <p>It was also a truly interdisciplinary project and allowed me to see how a mechatronics degree is useful in the workplace. I worked closely with the mechanical engineers to discuss ports and how the physical fixture would match what an operator is interacting with, I debated calibration algorithms (eventually settling on and implementing <b>particle swarm optimization</b>) with the software team, and frequently got feedback from the operators themselves, allowing me to present a finished product by the end of the term.</p>

        <p>I completed my first co-op position at Imagine Communications, a company that works in the broadcasting field out of Waterloo, ON. Looking back on this experience, I can’t believe how much I learned in such a short time.</p>
        <p>I worked as a DevOps Software Developer here, so I was quickly challenged with mastering many tools: <b>Terraform, Ansible, the Linux command line, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, and more.</b> I also had new syntax to pick up: <b>YAML, bash/PowerShell scripting, C#, & Groovy.</b> I value this experience so much because I learned a lot about how a product scales, gets tested, gets distributed, and is worked on by hundreds of individuals. Before, I only had practice tinkering on my own, so this was truly eye opening. Even though it’s not the work I do now, when I’m leading a project or contributing to its growth I have a much better idea of the bigger picture and how an idea can become a finished and marketable product.</p>
        <p>Huge shoutout to the community here as well, I completed this co-op remotely due to COVID but daily board game lunches online kept it really enjoyable throughout the term.</p>

          <h2 style="color: #1C6E8C;">PATH Student (TA)</h2>
          <p>One of the main reasons I cherish my high school experience so much is their introduction of the PATH program that allowed 12th graders to essentially become a <b>TA</b> for a course. The computer engineering courses I took in Grade 11 & 12 were life changing for me, so choosing to TA the Grade 10 version of the course was a no brainer for me. My excitement about the ordeal gained me a lot of free reign from my supervisor, with that I designed <b>lesson plans and projects surrounding computer history, binary, circuit components, logic gates, basic programming principles, and more.</b> Example projects shown below include a <b>7 segment LED</b> controlled by pushbuttons and a <b>solar powered alarm clock</b> circuit that features a 555 timer.</p>
          <p>My excitement about hardware, programming, and engineering in general grew tenfold during this time and it helped me confirm this is what I wanted to do. I learned how to take feedback from students and improve, how to design projects for different levels of background knowledge, and perhaps most importantly, how to communicate technical information effectively.</p>

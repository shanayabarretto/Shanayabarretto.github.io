                <p class="card-text">The idea for this project was given to me by one of my teachers during the pandemic. It is a circuit board with an attached pressure sensor that tells the user via LEDs whether their CPR compressions are of the right speed and pressure. I designed the board using eagle, printed it, drilled it, soldered it, and programmed it using Assembly Language.</p>

When learning to drive, I had trouble remembering safety checks (mirror, signal, shoulder, etc.) so I made this game to help me. It places you in a common on road scenario and allows you to practice maneuvering through the situation safely. It helped me obtain my G2!</p>

We were inspired by the app Locket and wanted to create an extension that allows friends to share a ‘new tab’ chrome background. For this project, I have been working on the backend side, using flask and SQL to help put it together.</p>

We used C to have the robot follow lines, pickup objects, and read barcodes. We completed a similar challenge last semester during Tron Design Days. </p>

                <p class="card-text">In my tech design class, we picked a FIRST Lego League competition prompt and designed the optimal robot for it, allowing me to become comfortable with 3d modelling software. I focused on the design of the wheels (which allow the robot to move both horizontally and vertically easily) and overall assembly. </p>

I also got my first taste of web design during the hackathon, as we made a website to accompany the app. Participating in this hackathon was so much fun, and I intend to attend many more in the future.</p>
